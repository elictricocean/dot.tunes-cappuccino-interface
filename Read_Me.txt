This Shared folder is part of a new DOT-TUNES feature which allows you to share virtually any files via DOT-TUNES.

Simply place any files in this shared folder which you would like to make available to others.

Then access:

http://yourdot-tunesaddress:9998/shared

You can place files, folders or aliases to folders. You can make an alias to an entire HD and place the alias in this shared folder and the entire HD will be available to others.

You can place an alias to your iPhoto Library in this folder to share all your iPhotos with others.

If you have created user accounts then only authenticated users can access the shared folder. If you have not created DOT-TUNES user accounts then anyone can access the files in the shared folder.

You can block the ability to view a directory listing of files by placing a blank text file called noaccess.txt in any folder within the shared folder. You can place this noaccess.txt file in the shared folder to block directory listings within the shared folder but directory listings will still be available within other folders within the shared folder.

Important note: if you have used the noaccess.txt file to block directory listings, files from that folder can still be downloaded by using the full url to the file.
